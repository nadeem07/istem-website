                        This can be extended to find volunteers for other services as well.

                        after
                        Demonetization, since the identifying features to distinguish currency by the blind are no

                    <li>Team8 worked on realtime object detection system using computer vision

                    </li>
                    <li>To encourage math and science in young children, team9 worked on a math quiz

                        for
                        elementary school students with extensive customisation for both students and their

                    </li>
                    <li>Team10 combined their knowledge in computer vision and NLP to identify objects
                        in
                        an
                        image, determine relationship between them and return a description of this relationship.
                    </li>
                    <li>Team11 implemented a novel game of snakes and ladders with Harry Potter.
