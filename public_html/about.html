                    <p>Inclusive Stem (I-Stem) is a group of young persons who are blind or visually impaired from India pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. Inspired by the challenges that many of us faced as STEM students in India, our goal is to make math and science education more accessible and inclusive in the country. We hope to do this through hands-on activities such as hackathons, advocacy and outreach initiatives, technical R&D and a strong community.</p>
                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>Our vision is a society where people with disabilities are no longer consumers of technology, but actively contribute to its advancement.</p>
<h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
<p>The core I-Stem team consists of nine members with a mix of backkgrounds, including current engineering students, alumni working in the tech industry and professionals working in disability and inclusion space for a long time.</p>
